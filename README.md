# Flask LMStudio Chatbot

This script was developed by Chat-GPT 3.5. It helps me understand the web applications and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

Get a deeper understanding of large language models.

Create a Flask web application with a route for handling the chat interface and another route for processing user input and generating model responses.

Create a HTML template for the chat interface where users can input messages and view responses.

Start a local inference sever with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/).

Execute Python script.

Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the chat interface and start interacting with the local language model.
